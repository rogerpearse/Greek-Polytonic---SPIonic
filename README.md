# Greek-Polytonic---SPIonic
Windows 11 Keyboard Map for Polytonic Greek, using SPIonic-like key mappings.

This is the source file and the build for a Greek polytonic keyboard for Windows 11, using the old SPIonic font keyboard layout.

See the readme.docx for exact mappings, and instructions on building a custom keyboard layout.

##Installation

First install the Greek Language for Windows.

Then the "Compiled" directory is a setup.exe.  Run that.  Then reboot.  You should end up with a new keyboard labelled SPIonic.

# Greek-Polytonic---SPIonic
Windows 11 Keyboard Map for Polytonic Greek, using SPIonic-like key mappings.

This is the source file and the build for a Greek polytonic keyboard for Windows 11, using the old SPIonic font keyboard layout.

See the readme.docx for exact mappings, and instructions on building a custom keyboard layout.

##Installation

First install the Greek Language and polytonic keyboard for Windows.  There are various instructions online: this one is as good as any.

Then look in the "Compiled" directory.  There is a setup.exe.  Run that to install the SPIonic keyboard.  Then reboot.  You should end up with a new keyboard labelled SPIonic.

Once you have this, you can deinstall any unneeded Greek keyboards.

If this works for you, great.  If not, deinstall it.  I offer no support or guarantees.  This is something I made for me!
